# HANA BoM Preparation

## Prerequisites

1. An editor for creating the HANA BoM file.
1. A HANA installation template.
1. SAP HANA media present on the Storage Account.
1. You have completed the download of `myDownloadBasketFiles.txt` to your workstation.

Your working folder should look something like this, although the folder name `HANA2_00_052_v001`, will be replaced with a similar name for the product you are building:

```text
   .
   └── HANA2_00_052_v001
       └── stackfiles
           └── myDownloadBasketFiles.txt
```

## Inputs

1. List of archive media for this version of HANA.
1. `ini` template for installing this version of HANA.

## Process

1. Within the `HANA2_00_052_v001` folder, create an empty text file called `bom.yml`.

   ```text
   .
   └── HANA2_00_052_v001
       ├── bom.yml      <-- BoM content will go in here
       └── stackfiles
           └── myDownloadBasketFiles.txt
   ```

### Example Partial BoM File

An example of a small part of a BoM file for HANA2.0. The `[x]` numbered sections are covered in the following documentation. Note that `v001` is a sequential number used to indicate the internal (non-SAP) version of the files included.

```text
step|BoM Content
    |
    |---
    |
[1] |name:    'HANA 2.00.052'
[2] |target:  'HANA 2.0'
[3] |version: 001
    |
[4] |defaults:
    |  archive_location: "https://npweeusaplib9545.file.core.windows.net/sapbits/archives/"
    |  target_location: "/usr/sap/install/downloads/"
    |
[5] |materials:
[6] |  media:
    |    - name:     SAPCAR
    |      version:  7.21
    |      archive:  SAPCAR_1320-80000935.EXE
    |
    |    - name:     IMDB LCAPPS 2.052
    |      archive:  IMDB_LCAPPS_2052_0-20010426.SAR
    |
    |    - name:     HANA 2.0
    |      version:  2.00.052
    |      archive:  XXX.ZIP
    |
[7] |  templates:
    |    - name:     HANA
    |      version:  2.0
    |      file:     hana2.0_v1.ini
```

### Create BoM Header

1. `[1]` and `[2]`: Record appropriate names for the build and target.

### Define BoM Version

1. `[3]` is an arbitrary number, chosen by you, which can be used to distinguish between any different versions you may have of this particular BoM. The value here should match the `_v...` numbering in the `bom.yml` parent folder, as described earlier.

### Create Defaults Section

1. `[4]`: This section contains:
   1. `archive_location`: The location to which you will upload the SAP build files. Also, the same location from which the files will be copied to the target server.
   1. `target_location`: The folder on the target server, into which the files will be copied for installation.

### Create Materials Section

1. `[5]`: Use exactly as shown. This specifies the start of the list of materials needed.

### Create List of Media

1. `[6]`: Specify `media:` exactly as shown.

1. Using **your editor**, for each item in your Download Basket, provide a suitable, descriptive name, together with the filename as `- name` and `archive` respectively into your `bom.yml` file. :information_source: The `version` property is optional.

   ```text
   - name:     SAPCAR
     version:  7.21
     archive:  SAPCAR_1320-80000935.EXE

   - name:     IMDB LCAPPS 2.052
     archive:  IMDB_LCAPPS_2052_0-20010426.SAR

   - name:     HANA 2.0
     version:  2.00.052
     archive:  XXX.ZIP
   ```

### Override Target Destination

Files downloaded or shared from the archive space will need to be extracted to the correct location on the target server. This is normally set using the `defaults -> target_location` property (see [the defaults section](#red_circle-create-defaults-section)). However, you may override this on a case-by-case basis.

1. For each relevant entry in the BoM `media` section, add an `override_target_location:` property with the correct target folder. For example:

   ```text
   - name:     HANA 2.0
     version:  2.00.052
     archive:  XXX.ZIP
     override_target_location: "/usr/sap/install/database/"
   ```

### Override Target Filename

By default, files downloaded or shared from the archive space will be extracted with the same filename as the `archive` filename on the target server.  However, you may override this on a case-by-case basis.

1. For each relevant entry in the BoM `media` section, add an `override_target_filename:` property with the correct target folder. For example:

   ```text
      - name:     SAPCAR
        version:  7.21
        archive:  SAPCAR_1320-80000935.EXE
        override_target_filename: SAPCAR.EXE
   ```

### Tidy Up Layout

The order of entries in the `media` section does not matter. However, for improved readability, you may wish to group related items together.

### Add Template Name

1. [7]: Create a `templates` section as shown, with the correct template name. Note that the `version` is optional. For example:

   ```text
     templates:
       - name:     HANA
         version:  2.0
         file:     hana2.0_v1.ini
   ```

### Upload Files to Archive Location

1. From the correct Azure storage account, navigate to "File shares", then to "sapbits".
1. For the `boms` folder in sapbits:
   1. Click the correct BoM folder name in the portal to open. In this example, that would be `HANA2_00_052_v001`, then:
   1. Click "Upload" and select the `bom.yml` file for upload.
   1. Click "Upload".

## Results and Outputs

1. A `bom.yml` file present in the Storage Account in the correct location. In this example, `sapbits/boms/HANA2_00_052_v001/bom.yml`.
