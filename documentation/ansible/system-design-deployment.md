# SAP System Design and Deployment

This document outlines a process that enables a SAP Basis System Administrator to produce repeatable baseline [SAP system landscapes](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_afs64/6.4/en-US/de/6b0d84f34d11d3a6510000e835363f/content.htm) running in Azure.
The repeatability applies both across different SAP products _and_ over time, as new SAP software versions are released.
For example, an administrator may have a requirement to deploy a consistent [3-tier system landscape](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_afs64/6.4/en-US/de/6b0da2f34d11d3a6510000e835363f/content.htm?no_cache=true) for S/4HANA 1909 SPS02 over the course of a few months, where Production is not required until 2-3 months after the Development system is required.
This can be a challenge when SAP removes available software versions, or a customer’s technical SAP personnel changes over time.

The process is aimed at users with some prior experience of both deploying SAP systems and with the Azure cloud platform.
For example, users should be familiar with: _SAP Launchpad_, _SAP Maintenance Planner_, _SAP Download Manager_, and _Azure Portal_.

The process described here consists of 3 distinct phases:

1. **_Acquisition_** of the SAP installation media, configuration files and tools;
1. **_Preparation_** of the SAP media library, and generation of the files required for automated deployments;
1. **_Deployment_** of the SAP landscape into Azure.

Two other phases are involved in the overall end-to-end lifecycle, but these are described elsewhere:

- **_Bootstrapping_** to deploy and configure the SAP Deployer and the SAP Library must be completed before _Preparation_;
- **_Provisioning_** to deploy the SAP target VMs into Azure must be completed before _Deployment_.

## Phase 1: Acquisition

### Phase 1 Prerequisites

- User must have an SAP account which has the correct permissions to download software and access Maintenance Planner
- User has [SAP Download Manager](https://softwaredownloads.sap.com/file/0030000001316872019) installed on their workstation

### Phase 1 Inputs

- SAP account login details (username, password)
- SAP System Product to deploy e.g. `S/4HANA`
- SAP Database configuration
- System name (SID)
- OS intended for use on HANA Infrastructure
- Language pack requirements

### Phase 1 Process

_**Note:** The Preparation and Deployment stages will be independent of each other in the sense that the preparation stage can happen at any time before the user wishes to begin the Deployment stage, however the Deployment cannot happen without Preparation being completed._

1. Create unique Stack Download Directory for SAP Downloads on User Workstation, e.g. `~/Downloads/S4HANA_1909_SP2/`
1. Log in to [SAP Launchpad](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#)
1. Navigate to Software Downloads to clear the download basket
1. Log in to [Maintenance Planner](https://support.sap.com/en/alm/solution-manager/processes-72/maintenance-planner.html)
1. Design System, e.g. `S/4HANA`
1. Download Stack XML file to Stack Download Directory
1. Click `Push to Download Basket`
1. Download additional files (Stack Text File, PDF, Excel export)
1. Download and install the
1. Log into SAP Download Basket within SAP Download Manager
1. Set download directory to Stack Download Directory created in Phase 1 step 1
1. Download all files into empty DIR on workstation
1. If Database Installation media is also required:
   1. Create unique Stack Download Directory for SAP Downloads on User Workstation, e.g. `~/Downloads/HANA2.0/`
   1. Find the SAP HANA Database media (Database and any additional components required) and add to download basket
   1. Log into SAP Download Basket within SAP Download Manager
   1. Set download directory to Stack Download Directory created in Phase 1 step 13, i
   1. Download all files into empty DIR on workstation

### Phase 1 Results and Outputs

- XML Stack file
- SAP Installation Media
- Stack Download Directory path containing Installation Media

## Phase 2: Preparation

### Phase 2 Prerequisites

- Acquisition process complete

### Phase 2 Inputs

- SAP XML Stack file stored on user’s workstation in the Stack Download Directory.
- SAP Media stored on user’s workstation in the Stack Download Directory.
- SAP Library.

### Phase 2 Process

1. Upload SAP Media from workstation to SAP Library.
   This process will create a repository of archive files, tools and Stack files to be used when deploying systems (see [Example SAP Library file structure](#example-sap-library-file-structure)).
1. Upload the downloaded media and stack files to the sapbits container in the Storage Account for the SAP Library, using the directory structure shown in the [Example SAP Library file structure](#example-sap-library-file-structure).
1. Create SAP Unattended Installation Template(s) (process TBD in Milestone 2).
1. Upload into SAP Library.
1. Create the BoM file.
1. Populate BoM with required inputs shown in the [Example Bill of Materials (BoM) file](#example-bill-of-materials-bom-file).
1. Upload BoM files to SAP Library.
1. Define SAP Library path Storage account in Ansible either in the Ansible inventory or passed into a playbook as a parameter i.e sap_lib_root_url: `https://<storage_acount_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/`. The same applies to the file destination on the target vm as all media will be extracted to one directory.

```

**Notes:**

1. All Installation Media tools and files for all systems designed by the user will be contained within a single flat directory to avoid duplication.
1. The Bill of Materials directory (BoMs/) will contain a folder for each system the user designs. The recommended naming convention for these folders will use the product type(e.g. S4HANA), product version (e.g. 1909), and a version marker (e.g. v1). This allows the user to update a particular system BoM and retain an earlier version should it ever be needed.
1. The Bill of Materials file (bom.yml) and template files (hana.ini, application.ini) will be created following manual steps (process TBD in Milestone 2).
1. Additional SAP files obtained from SAP Maintenance Planner (the XML Stack file, Text file representation of stack file, the PDF and xls files) will be stored in a subfolder for a particular BoM.
1. Stack files are made unique by an index, e.g. `MP_<type>_<index>_<date>_<???>.<filetype>` where `<type>` is Stack, Plan, or Excel, `<index>` is a 10 digit integer, `<date>` is in format yyyymmdd, `<???>` is SWC for the Excel type and empty for the rest, and `<filetype>` is xls for type Excel, pdf for type Plan, and txt or xml for type Stack.

#### Example Bill of Materials (BoM) file

File `BoMs/S4HANA_1909_v001/bom.yml`:

```yaml
---

name:    'S/4HANA - 1909'
version: 001
target:  'ABAP PLATFORM 1909'

materials:
  dependencies:
    - name:     HANA2.0
      version:  003

  tools:
    - name:     SAPCAR
      version:  7.21
      archive:  SAPCAR_1320-80000935.EXE

    - name:     SWPM
      version:  2.0
      archive:  SWPM20SP05_5-80003424.SAR

  media:
    - name:     ABAP_ASCS
      version:  1909
      archive:  S4CORE101.SAR.SAR
      template: ABAP_ASCS_INI

  templates:
    - name:     ABAP_ASCS_INI
      version:  1909.2
      file:     abap_ascs_1909_v2.ini

    - name:     ABAP_ASCS_XML
      version:  1909.1
      file:     abap_ascs_1909_v2.xml
```

**Notes:**

1. The configuration for each individual HANA (or database) component will be stored in dependent BoMs, in order to allow for independent deployments when required.
1. The dependency with name `HANA2.0` and version `003` corresponds to the BoM file `BoMs/HANA2.0_v001/bom.yml` which would contain the actual SAP HANA version within the `materials.media` list.
1. Any `tools` or `media` materials with `.SAR` archives will be extracted
1. Any `tools` materials will be extracted with `0755` permissions
1. Any `media` materials will be extracted with `0644` permissions

### Phase 2 Results and Outputs
